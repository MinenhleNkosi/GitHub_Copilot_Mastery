# Set up, configure, and troubleshoot GitHub Copilot

Now you'll learn how to sign up for GitHub Copilot, how to configure GitHub Copilot by using VS Code, and how to troubleshoot GitHub Copilot by using VS Code.

To get started, select your GitHub profile photo, and then select **Settings**. Copilot is on the left menu under **Code**, **planning**, and **automation**.

After you sign up, you need to install an extension for your preferred environment. GitHub Copilot supports GitHub.com (which doesn't need an extension), VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim as an unobtrusive extension.

2. A popup dialog asks you to open VS Code. Select **Open**.
3. In VS Code, on the **Extension: GitHub Copilot** tab, select **Install**.
4. If you didn't previously authorize VS Code in your GitHub account, you're prompted to sign in to GitHub in VS Code. Select **Sign in to GitHub**.

GitHub Copilot can autocomplete code as you type when you use VS Code. After installation, you can enable or disable GitHub Copilot, and you can configure advanced settings within VS Code.
