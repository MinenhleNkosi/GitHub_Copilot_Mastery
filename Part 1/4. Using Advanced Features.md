# Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI coding partner that provides autocomplete suggestions while you code. Get suggestions by typing code or interactively using natural language.

Copilot analyses your file and related files, offering suggestions in your text editor. It uses context from written code and comments, and then suggests new lines or entire functions.

GitHub Codespaces is a hosted developer environment operating in the cloud that can be run with Visual Studio Code. You can customize the development experience for any development project on GitHub, preinstalling dependencies, libraries, and even Visual Studio Code extensions and settings.
