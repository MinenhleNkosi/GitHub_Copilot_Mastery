# Introduction

- Copilot Spaces let you focus AI on specific files, issues, and instructions for more consistent answers.
- Spaces differ from general Copilot Chat by using tightly scoped context.
- You can attach files, issues, and instructions to guide Copilot.
- Use Spaces for repeatable, domain-specific tasks to improve quality and consistency.

## What is a GitHub Copilot Space?

It’s a dedicated Copilot chat grounded in a curated set of context you choose. The Space is itself like a LLM and you can feed it GitHub files, issues, pull requests, and your own free‑text instructions to provide context to your specific topic.

## Setting Context for Copilot Spaces

The effectiveness of a Copilot Space depends on the context you provide. You can attach specific files (such as scripts, configuration, or documentation), relevant issues or pull requests, and tailored instructions. By curating this input, you help Copilot focus on the information that matters most for your scenario. The context order matters: leading with the most critical files or instructions helps drive more accurate and relevant responses.

## Setup: Attaching Files (Uploads) and Instructions in Copilot Spaces

Attaching Files (Uploads):

- In the Space setup, use the "Attach files" or "Add context" button to select one or more files from your GitHub repository.
- You can attach source code files, markdown docs, configuration files, or other assets as context. These files are referenced from the default branch, so your Space stays up to date as your repo evolves.
- If allowed by your workspace settings, you may also upload files directly (such as images or datasets) from your local machine for non-repo context.
- Use the "Instructions" section to provide specific guidance to Copilot. This can include goals ("Summarize the onboarding process"), style preferences ("Write in a formal tone"), or canonical examples ("Sample output should look like…").
- Keep instructions brief, focused, and actionable. If your Space serves a workflow or troubleshooting guide, include step-by-step tasks or sample prompts.
- You can update instructions at any time to refine the focus of your Space.

## Create your first space

- Creating a Space gives Copilot a focused, reusable workspace with clear context.
- Name your Space clearly and choose personal or organization ownership.
- Add context using instructions (free text) and attachments (files, issues, PRs, uploads).
- Organization and clarity in Spaces lead to better, more relevant Copilot responses.

# Sharing, Discoverability, and Governance

To ensure your Space delivers lasting value, it must be easy to find, securely shared, and well-maintained. This unit focuses on how to manage visibility, follow GitHub permissions, and keep content fresh as your codebase evolves. You'll also learn lightweight governance strategies—from assigning ownership and adding usage guidance to setting up a review cadence—to ensure your Space remains accurate, discoverable, and aligned with team needs.

In this unit, you’ll learn:

- How to manage visibility and sharing within your organization
- How GitHub permissions secure and govern access to linked content
- Why naming conventions and descriptions boost discoverability
- Best practices for Space ownership, freshness, and review cycles

## Visibility and sharing

Successful Spaces are easy to find, safe to share, and clearly "owned." When you create a Space, set visibility according to how broadly you intend others to use it. Depending on your environment, options may include keeping it under your personal ownership or making it visible to your organization.

Share the Space by link and, where available, rely on org-level browsing or catalogs to improve discoverability. Use a clear, purpose‑driven title, and a short description that states the scope ("one job per Space"), intended audience, and expected outputs so teammates immediately know when to use it.

## Versioning and freshness

Spaces stay fresh by referencing live GitHub sources. Linked files reflect the repository's default branch, and attached issues and pull requests evolve as they change, reducing the need to copy content into separate documents. If you need branch‑specific guidance or a historical snapshot, consider narrowing your references to the relevant files, adding a brief example in free text, or—if supported in your environment—attaching a text file that captures the exact content you want the Space to use. Keep the scope small so updates remain predictable and grounded.

## Governance

Treat governance as lightweight but intentional. Assign an owner who maintains the Space, add a short "How to use this Space" note at the top of the instructions, and include 1–3 canonical examples that define "good" output. Establish naming conventions (for example, "ServiceName—Onboarding Helper") and review cadence (for example, at each release) to prune stale sources and keep instructions aligned with reality. When a Space grows beyond a single job, split it into smaller Spaces so discoverability stays high and answer quality remains consistent.

Use this checklist when creating or updating a Space to keep it easy to find, safe to share, and reliably useful. Options (for example, org ownership, uploads) may vary by environment.

Naming and Purpose

- [ ] Choose a clear, purpose‑driven title (for example, "ServiceName—Onboarding Helper"); keep "one job per Space."
- [ ] Write a 1–2 sentence description that states scope, intended audience, and expected outputs.
- [ ] Add a brief "How to use this Space" note at the top of the instructions.

Ownership and Visibility

- [ ] Set the correct owner (individual or organization, if available).
- [ ] Select appropriate visibility (private, org‑visible, etc.).
- [ ] Verify access with a non‑owner who expected GitHub permissions (Spaces inherit repo/issue/PR permissions).
- [ ] Share the URL and, where available, add collaborators.

Security and Privacy

- [ ] Don't paste sensitive data into free‑text; prefer linking version‑controlled files where normal review/permissions apply.
- [ ] Ensure all attached sources are suitable for the chosen visibility.
- [ ] If uploads are supported, limit the text content you’re comfortable sharing.
- [ ] Remove obsolete or confidential materials.

Discoverability and Docs

- [ ] Use consistent naming conventions across Spaces (team/service prefixes help).
- [ ] Add tags/keywords in the description to aid search.
- [ ] Announce or catalog the Space in your org’s preferred directory/channel.

Review Cadence and Governance

- [ ] Assign a maintainer/owner responsible for updates.
- [ ] Set a review cadence (for example, monthly or per release).
- [ ] At each review: validate links, test 2–3 representative prompts, update examples, prune noisy sources, and confirm visibility.
- [ ] Track feedback and improvement requests (issues, discussion, or a simple checklist in the description).

# Do's and Don'ts of Working in a Space

- **Do**: Keep questions focused on attached sources for grounded answers.
- **Don’t**: @‑mention people or extensions—these won’t work in Spaces.
- **Do**: Use Spaces for single tasks/domains and reuse its terminology.
- **Do**: Use clear, verifiable prompts and ask for traceable, runnable outputs.
- **Don’t**: Expect Copilot to access content not attached to the Space.
- **Do**: Refine instructions, add quality examples, and remove irrelevant sources if answers drift.
- **Don’t**: Let Spaces grow too large—split them if needed for precision.
- **Do**: Keep context updated and well-ordered; link files for version control.
- **Don’t**: Paste sensitive data—link or upload files instead.
